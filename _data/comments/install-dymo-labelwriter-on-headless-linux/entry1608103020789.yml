message: "Hi mate, Great work. I got the CUPS drivers successfully installed on Ubuntu 20.4 and the printer (fully-functional) shows up in my list of printers.  \r\n\r\nCan't seem to find any application software to format the labels  for printing though -- Dymo says their software is Win/Mac only.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nCheers and thanks!"
