  This worked like a charm, although I do now have a different issue. I setup a
  LabelWriter 4XL, found the correct driver and copied it in the same way you
  describe above for the 450. If I look in CUPS, I have it set to use the
  default 4x6" labels. When I add the printer to Windows 10 it all works
  fine.... except that the page size only shows A4 & Letter.  It seems to be
  because those are the only available sizes for the Microsoft IPP Class Driver.
  It does print, but it's cut off at the top, and any print preview shows it as
  a full page.  If I change the driver to be the LabelWrite 4XL driver, then I
  can now select my label size... but of course now nothing prints to the
  printer. Any ideas?
