  Great post! I have some gaps in knowledge still, though: my DS218+ is on a
  192.168.1.0/24 subnet and Docker containers running on it get assigned to a
  bridge interface using the 172.17.0.0/24 subnet. The Portainer container
  starts up, and 'docker inspect portainer' shows it has an IP address of
  172.17.0.2, but I'm not able to reach it. A tracert shows destination
  unreachable from the router. Any advice on what steps I'm missing? I'd guess a
  static route, but am unsure of the proper way to configure that. Thanks for
  the help!
